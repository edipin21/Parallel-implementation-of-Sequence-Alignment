# Parallel-implementation-of-Sequence-Alignment



Sequence Alignment â€“ a way to estimate a similarity of two strings of letters - is an important field in
bioinformatics1. Sequence is a string of capital letters.

Each letter in the sequence represents DNA, RNA, or protein. Identification of region of similarity of
set of Sequences is extremely time consuming.
Sequence Alignment of two sequences. The purpose of the project is to parallelize the basic algorithm
to produce an efficient computation within MPI, OpenMP and CUDA environment.
